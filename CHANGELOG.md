# Version history

## 4.0
September 27, 2020

### Breaking changes ⚠️
- Release track name is now mandatory in job configuration ([JENKINS-62398](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-62398), [#33](https://github.com/jenkinsci/google-play-android-publisher-plugin/pull/33))
  - For jobs configured without a track name, or without a `trackName` for Pipeline, you must now set its value to `production` if you wish to retain the previous behaviour
- Rollout percentage is now mandatory in job configuration ([JENKINS-62516](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-62516), [#36](https://github.com/jenkinsci/google-play-android-publisher-plugin/pull/36))
  - For jobs configured without a rollout percentage, or without a `rolloutPercentage` for Pipeline, you must now set its value to `100` if you wish to retain the previous behaviour

For a minimally configured Pipeline job, these changes would look something like this:
```diff
   // Upload and release immediately to 100% of users in Production
-  androidApkUpload googlePlayCredentialsId: 'gp'
+  androidApkUpload googlePlayCredentialsId: 'gp',
+                   trackName: 'production',
+                   rolloutPercentage: '100'
```
